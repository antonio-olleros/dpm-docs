# DPM Expression Language (DPM-XL) Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **Data Point Model Expression Language (DPM-XL)**, a formal language for expressing data validation and calculation requirements in regulatory reporting.

## What is DPM-XL?

The DPM Expression Language is a formal, business-user-friendly language that enables the specification of:

- **Data validation rules** for regulatory reporting
- **Calculation formulas** for derived data points
- **Data transformation operations** across reporting tables
- **Cross-module validations** and consistency checks

DPM-XL serves as the foundation for automated validation systems used by regulatory authorities such as EBA and EIOPA.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Business-Oriented**
Designed for business users who understand regulatory requirements but may not be programmers.

### ‚ö° **Formally Specified**
Fully formalized syntax and semantics enable automated compilation and execution.

### üîÑ **Dual Representation**
- **DPM-XL**: Human-readable expression language
- **DPM-ML**: Machine-readable metamodel representation

### üìä **Rich Data Model**
Supports complex data structures including scalars, sets, and multi-dimensional recordsets.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Robust**
Comprehensive null handling, type system, and error management.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple DPM-XL expression:

```dpm-xl
{F_01.01, r0010, c0010} = {F_01.01, r0020, c0010} + {F_01.01, r0030, c0010}
```

This expression validates that the value in table F_01.01, row 0010, column 0010 equals the sum of rows 0020 and 0030 in the same column.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized to take you from basic concepts to advanced implementation:

### üèóÔ∏è [Information Model](information-model/01-introduction.md)
Understand the core data structures: operations, artifacts (scalars, sets, recordsets), and data types.

### ‚öôÔ∏è [Operators](operators/01-introduction.md)
Comprehensive reference for all operators, organized by category:
- Selection, Numeric, Comparison, Logical
- Aggregate, Conditional, String, Time, Clause


### üìñ [Grammar](grammar/01-introduction.md)
Quick reference materials, grammar specifications, and operator summaries.
