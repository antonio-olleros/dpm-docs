# 3 DPM-XL Data Selection

The data for the expression language is selected by referencing the DPM *Cells* and *Key Variables* of DPM Report Tables.

The references to the *Cells* and *Key Variables* are done by means of the table codes, ordinate codes and the codes of the Properties associated to the *Key Variables*.

The data selection is done by the interaction of the selection *Operator*, represented by the curly brackets symbol, and the general scope of an expression, provided by the with *Operator*. With this interaction, it is possible to individuate individual DPM *Variables* or sets of them. The actual data are referring to DPM *Variables*, thus making it possible to obtain the data required for the calculations.

The selection of data, together with the DPM definitions, make it possible to determine the *Structure* of the *Recordset* on compile-time.
