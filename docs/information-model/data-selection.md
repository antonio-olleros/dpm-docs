# 3 DPM-XL data selection

The data for the expression language is selected by referencing the DPM Cells and Key Variables of DPM Report Tables.

The references to the Cells and Key variables are done by means of the table codes, ordinate codes and the codes of the Properties associated to the Key Variables.

The data selection is done by the interaction of the selection operator, represented by the curly brackets symbol, and the general scope of an expression, provided by the with operator. With this interaction, it is possible to individuate individual DPM Variables or sets of them. The actual data are referring to DPM Variables, thus making it possible to obtain the data required for the calculations.

The selection of data, together with the DPM definitions, make it possible to determine the Structure of the Recordset on compile-time.
