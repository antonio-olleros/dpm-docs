# 1 Introduction

This documentation provides the individual description of the semantics for all the *Operators* in the DPM Operations (DPM-XL and DPM-ML).

The document is structured from more generic to more concrete. It starts with general behaviours that apply to several *Operators* of different types. Then it follows with the common behaviour of the *Operators* of the same type, finalizing with the specific behaviour of the single *Operators*.
