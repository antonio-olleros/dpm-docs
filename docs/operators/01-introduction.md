# 1 Introduction

This documentation provides the individual description of the semantics for all the operators in the DPM Operations (DPM-XL and DPM-ML).

The document is structured from more generic to more concrete. It starts with general behaviours that apply to several operators of different types. Then it follows with the common behaviour of the operators of the same type, finalizing with the specific behaviour of the single operators.
